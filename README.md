# Crimson editor

Created to have completely freedom for my app [Crimson](https://github.com/amzamora/crimson).

## How to use it

You createad and HTML file with a pre element with and id. Then you pass that id when instantiating
CrimsonEditor.

Then you can use the following methods:

- `setText(text)        // Receives a string`
- `setFontSize(number)  // Receives size in pixels`
- `insertAtCursor(text) // Receives a string`

## How does it work
